## Overview

It's about time. I've got experience. I've acquired the necessary high income skills: coding, design, sales, writing. I've started and failed enough times. Yet, I've got nothing to show for it.

Something has got to change and I am putting this in writing, online, for the whole world to see, so I can be accountable to myself and the people I have made promises to and shared ideas with.

So what is going to change this time?

## 01 My Health.

Started working out again this year. The last time I went to the gym was 2022. I should never stop working out for more than 3 months. I know I am in decent shape for the regular young adult but I can do better.

I will do better; I must do better; So, I promise to do better.

## 02. My Business

In the past, I have failed at many business. My app businesses failed or I could never really launch... or so I thought. However, my service delivery(digital agency) and e-commerce businesses flourished till I decided to stop. I was childish, I know. I prioritised poorly. I was scared to succeed.

With a mindset of abundance lately, I am dedicating my life to my businesses now.

- An e-book store
- A digital marketing agency
- A web design/software agency
- An education business for entrepreneurs

## 03. Twitter

Deactivated my main account today. It's full of garbage and it does not serve me well. I will miss the fun, but fuck it. I'm not a boy anymore.

So here's to my new account. I will tweet mostly about my experience in sales as I build my businesses above in public. I believe sales is king now. There's so much money out there to be made and I can only catch a sniff of that if I up my game in sales. Topping off my technical skills with sales will make me a monster. I dare you to change my mind.

## 05. Youtube

Yes, I am starting a Youtube. I want to document my progress from my lowest till I am successful. Other pplatforms will surely follow.

## 06. Planning & Routines

All the above requires serious planning and time management. This will require putting some strict systems in place and bringing a lot of order into my life. Consistency and patience are the most important skills. None of this will ever happen if I am not consistent and being pateient with the process.
