## What is ATP-Stories?

First of all, ATP-Stories stands for Amazing Tech People Stories. I borrowed the name from ADPList, the mentorship platform. The goal is to share stories of the amazing people who work in tech in order to encourage people who are currently struggling or have lost hope to keep going. The idea is to make newbies aware that, experienced professionals can realate

## Why is this necessary?

Starting a career in tech can get overwhelming. Heck! Even experienced engineers are overwhelmed by the amount of things they want to learn! As rewarding as a career in tech may seem to be, it is simply a career of continuous self-improvement, learning and growth.

When starting, the beginning may seem quite abstract and difficult to grasp. While learning and growing, one may be faced with several mental health issues such as impostor syndrome, lack of self, confidence and many others.

ATP-Stories exists to make sure that, this experience is pretty much normal and time heals all wounds. While I` understand that this cannot be the best solution to such mental health issues, I aim to provide resources as well, to help people navigate their feelings and expectations when pursuing a career in tech.

## Community

I want to create a storytelling community in tech, where experienced professionals feel confident to contribute by sharing stories that inspire. Simply that!

## As a learning project

Of course, I want to build this with code, Nextjs. Of course, I want to learn how to build this from scratch. I am transitionaing to backend development so I am looking forward to over-engineering the backend and learing as muuch as I can. Also, as a community porject, I want to build this in public. I hope to get the confidence to do so. Kindly supoprt when you come across my tweets/posts about ATP-Stories.

## Wrapping things up

In the end, this is supposed to be a tool that slightly makes the world a better place. If a single story on ATP-Stories is able to inspire anyone to keep going, my job is done. I will keep this project running for as long as I can. I will be glad to get support in any form.

Great Day!
