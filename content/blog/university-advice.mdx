1. **Join the KNUST Debaters' Club:** Engage with the KNUST Debaters' Club to hone
   your skills in articulation, argument delivery, and to delve into the general psychology around public speaking, charisma and self-confidence.

2. **Reading:** Books share great experiences and perspectives. Explore subjects like human behavior & psychology, economics and world economics, autobiographies, biographies, politics, money and books on how the world works!

3. **Volunteer at Career and Tech Events:** Put yourself in spaces where you are helping out at an event that can positively impact your career as a young professional. Involve yourself in planning, contribute funds to support the event or simply be resoruceful to the organizing team. Ask questions at such events as well, and be bold to connect with the speakers and industry professionals after the event.
   Here's my free game to you: _"Hello [Name_Of Speaker], I really enjoyed your talk about [Insert_Topic]. My name is Kafui, a developer and telecom student. Do you mind if we connect so we can discuss this topic further? I do not want to waste all your time here."_

4. **Initiate a Campus Non-Profit:** Establish a campus-centric non-profit, catering to students' needs.Create platforms for internships, book donations, peer learning, or mentorship programs. Lecturers love students like this! Your department may market you for this. This gives you a lot of confidence as a student. Apply for many startup/hackathons as possible and pitch your project. With enough recognition, this can catapult your professional career to unimaginable heights, even as a student.

5. **Keep Friends who are Active in Campus Politics:** Historically, they tend to leverage networks beneficially post-graduation. Learn this from me now: _The easiest way to get a job is through connections and not by sending out job applications. Well, at least, in the tech industry._

6. **Volunteer to Speak at Events:** Offer your expertise at campus events. Showcase your projects and skills, yet maintain humility and foster growth in others.

7. **Learn to Swim:** Embrace new experiences, and acquire skills outside your academic and professional spheres.

8. **Prioritize Relationships:** Invest time in personal relationships, and nurture meaningful connections. A balanced life can enhance both personal fulfillment and professional growth. Son, get a girlfriend.
