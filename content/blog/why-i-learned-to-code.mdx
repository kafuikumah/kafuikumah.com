### University: Pursuing Telecommunication Engineering.

I was eighteen years old and a telecommunication engineering student at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). I chose to pursue that programme because I was very enthused about the internet and how it worked. Without doing the most intensive research I could do at the time, this programme was a no-brainer.

### Balancing Academics and Coding Crossroads.

Fast forward two semesters, and I found myself brimming with app ideas, brainstorming solutions for various problems around me—most of which were app concepts. By this point, I was convinced that pursuing a tertiary education in telecommunications engineering was not my passion. However, my parents remained steadfast in their expectations. Throughout my life, their influence had guided my decisions, and I held them in deep respect, striving always to make them proud, as had my siblings before me. Consequently, I continued to navigate the challenges of being a telecommunications engineering student, all while fervently sharing my app ideas with friends and like-minded individuals. This passion often overshadowed my academic commitments.

### Creating with Code.

I reached out to student developers on campus to assist me in building out these ideas. That was when I met Norris and Kwaku(an acquaintance from high school). This is when I decided to take up coding as a skill to bring my ideas to life! I was insatiably curious! Those two guys will eventually influence my career as we went on to work together on other projects.

### Making a Difference with Projects.

Learning to code was exciting. I started creating solutions, though sometimes I overlooked details like who would use them or their real-world applications. But I was passionate about building and innovating.

Through my coding journey, I worked on various projects. Here's a list of some:

1. Teknokrat — A KNUST SRC App. (2015)

2. Fluwid — A payment system which used vouchers. (2016 -Demo )

3. Bookhub — A bank for all slides and learning materials of all university programmes, accessible by all students, for free.(2016)

4. PicApp — A food delivery app. (2017–2018)

5. Deck Foundation - A book donation non-profit platform. Gather your books. Fill the form. We pick them up and donate to kids.(2018-2019)

6. Nsuo — Water delivery and plastic recycling platform at Roots Digital, now Swoove. (2019)

7. Thryll — Online ticketing platform while at Roots Digital, now Swoove. (2019)

8. Curashops — E-commerce website builder with delivery service to seamlessly connecting e-commerce products to customers seamlessly while at Roots Digital, now Swoove(2019)

9. Ansyla — Making high quality formal education content free and accessible for students from primary school to tertiary level.(2021-2022)

10. ZeroExperience — A platform to help you get started in Tech by providing mentorship, learning resources and a job board for entry level roles. (2022 — Present)

    …and many other freelance projects and employee projects in between.

### Why Software Engineering?

Becoming a software engineer was more than a career choice; it was my way to make a positive change in the world. I aimed to improve things for people around me, and this goal always drove me forward.
