### University: Pursuing Telecommunication Engineering.

I was eighteen years old and a telecommunication engineering student at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). I chose to pursue that programme because I was very enthused about the internet and how it worked. Without doing the most intensive research I could do at the time, this programme was a no-brainer.

### Balancing Academics and Coding Crossroads.

Fast forward two semesters, and I found myself brimming with app ideas, brainstorming solutions for various problems around me—most of which were app concepts. By this point, I was convinced that pursuing a tertiary education in telecommunications engineering was not my passion. However, my parents remained steadfast in their expectations. Throughout my life, their influence had guided my decisions, and I held them in deep respect, striving always to make them proud, as had my siblings before me. Consequently, I continued to navigate the challenges of being a telecommunications engineering student, all while fervently sharing my app ideas with friends and like-minded individuals. This passion often overshadowed my academic commitments.

### Creating with Code.

I reached out to student developers on campus to assist me in building out these ideas. That was when I met Norris and Kwaku(an acquaintance from high school). This is when I decided to take up coding as a skill to bring my ideas to life! I was insatiably curious! Those two guys will eventually influence my career as we went on to work together on other projects.

### Making a Difference with Projects.

Learning to code was exciting. I started creating solutions, though sometimes I overlooked details like who would use them or their real-world applications. But I was passionate about building and innovating.

Through my coding journey, I worked on various projects. Here's a list of some:

1. Teknokrat — KNUST's SRC App (2015)
2. Fluwid — A voucher-based payment system (2016 - Demo)
3. Bookhub — An expansive repository for academic materials (2016 - Class project)
4. PicApp — Revolutionizing food delivery (2017–2018)
5. Deck Foundation — Book donation platform (2018–2019)
6. Nsuo — Pioneering water delivery, initially under Roots Digital, now Swoove (2018-2019 - Ministry of Sanitation Hackathon Winner)
7. Thryll — Map-based online ticketing for events, under Roots Digital, now Swoove (2019)
8. Curiashops — Empowering e-commerce ventures with integrated delivery service, under Roots Digital, now Swoove (2019)
9. Ansyla — A comprehensive MOOC platform spanning primary to tertiary education.(2022)
10. ZeroExperience — Empowering tech novices (2022)
    ...complemented by an array of freelance and collaborative endeavors.

### Why Software Engineering?

Becoming a software engineer was more than a career choice; it was my way to make a positive change. I aimed to improve things for people around me, and this goal always drove me forward.
